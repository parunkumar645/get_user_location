User Location Project
Overview
This project is designed to provide users with a simple web application to retrieve their current location. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application leverages the 'Nominatim API' for geolocation data. The primary feature is a 'Get Location' button, initiating a prompt for users to grant location permission.

Purpose
The primary goal is to showcase the integration of geolocation services into web applications. By obtaining the user's consent, the application fetches their current city and country, offering a seamless and interactive experience.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure for the web page.
CSS: Implements styling for an enhanced user interface.
JavaScript: Enables interactivity and handles location-related functionalities.
Nominatim API: Utilized to retrieve geolocation data based on latitude and longitude.
How It Works
Get Location Button: Clicking the 'Get Location' button prompts the user to grant location permission.
Location Retrieval: Upon permission, the application uses the 'Nominatim API' to fetch the user's current city and country.
Display: The retrieved location details are displayed on the web page.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Click the 'Get Location' button to initiate the location retrieval process.
Grant location permission when prompted.
Notes
Ensure that your browser supports geolocation services for optimal functionality.
In case of permission denial, a message guides the user to allow access to their location.
